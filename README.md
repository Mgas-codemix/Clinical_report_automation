This Python script automates the process of generating Word reports by extracting specific data from a MultiQC HTML report and tables from an Excel file. The final report includes both text (extracted data) and tables, and it's built using a pre-defined Word template.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

Argument Parsing:

The script uses argparse to handle command-line arguments, allowing the user to specify:
-inFile: The path to the MultiQC HTML report.
-template: The path to the Word template file.
-excelfile: The path to the Excel file that contains additional tables.
-outdir: The directory where the generated Word reports will be saved.
MultiQC Parsing:

The parse_multiqc_report() function uses BeautifulSoup to parse the MultiQC HTML file.
It looks for specific sections in the HTML (e.g., coverage and quality metrics) and extracts the relevant values.
The extracted values are returned in a dictionary, with keys like 'coverage' and 'quality'.
Excel Table Extraction:

The extract_tables_from_excel() function reads the entire Excel file using Pandas and returns the tables (as DataFrames) for each sheet in the Excel file.
If the Excel file contains multiple sheets, each sheet is represented as a separate key in the dictionary returned by this function.
Inserting Tables into Word:

The insert_table_from_dataframe() function inserts a DataFrame into a Word document as a table.
It creates a new table in the Word document and populates it with the data from the DataFrame (including headers and rows).
Replacing Placeholders in the Word Template:

The replace_placeholders() function scans through the paragraphs in the Word document and replaces placeholders (e.g., <<SampleID>>, <<CoverageValue>>) with actual values extracted from the MultiQC report.
Generating the Final Report:

The generate_reports_from_multiqc_and_excel() function creates a final Word report by:
Replacing placeholders in the Word template with the extracted MultiQC data.
Inserting tables from the Excel file.
Saving the report as a .docx file in the specified output directory.
Main Function:

The main() function orchestrates the entire process:
It parses the command-line arguments.
Extracts data from the MultiQC report and Excel file.
Generates the final report using the Word template.
